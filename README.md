# DSA Learning
Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning repository! This repo is a collection of my journey and progress in learning DSA, where I will be organizing problems, solutions, and explanations in swift programming languages.

## Topics Covered
This repository includes solutions and explanations for various data structures and algorithms, such as:

- Array
- Moore's Voting Algorithm
- Intermediate Problem

### Array Problems
1. Reverse an Array
2. Find the maximum and minimum element
3. Find the second largest and second smallest elements
4. Move zeros to end
5. Left rotate an array by D places
6. Right rotate an array by D places
7. Union and intersection of two sorted arrays
8. Check if array is sorted
9. Find the missing number
10. Find the Numbers that Appears once.

### Moore's Voting Algorithm
1. Find the majority elements(Elements appears more than [n / 2] times)
2. Find the First and Last position of an Elements in a Sorted Array.
3. Find the majority elements(Elements appears more than [n / 3] times)
4. Find All Elements that appears more than [n / k] times
5. Find the Celebrity in a party (Known no one, but everyone knows them)
6. Find the majority elements in a stream of numbers
7. Find the most frequent elements in a 2D Grid
8. Find the most common word on a large text file
9. Detect a Plagiarized sentence using majority voting
10. Find the most voted Candidate in an Election Poll
11. Find the most repeated elements in a sliding window of size k

### Intermediate Problem
1. Kadane's Algorithm (Maximum Subarray sum)
2. Two Sum Problem (Two-Pointer)
3. Three Sum Problem
4. Rearrange Positive and Negative Numbers alternately
5. Sort an Array of 0s and 1s and 2s (Dutch National Flag)
6. Next Premutation of an Array
7. Stocks Buy and Sell Problem
8. Find the first and last Position of an element in a sorted array
